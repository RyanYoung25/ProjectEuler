Project Euler In Haskell
===============

This repository has a bunch of my solutions to some project euler challenges in haskell. 

The reason that I started to tackle these challenges was to learn Haskell so a lot of the code that you see may not meet the crieteria of best practices in Haskell. None the less, I have been slowly but surely building up my understanding of Haskell and starting to think more in the functional programming mind set. 

I put these snippets of code up on github in the hopes that someone might find these useful to their own learning goals. In addition if someone is reading this and has some helpful comments or tips that would help me in learning I'd be happy to hear them.
